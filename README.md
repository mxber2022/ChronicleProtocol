# Volatility Vista

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind Volatility Vista was the need for a reliable and accurate measure of volatility in the cryptocurrency market. With the increasing popularity and complexity of cryptocurrencies, there was a demand for a tool that could provide real-time and comprehensive insights into price fluctuations. We wanted to create a solution that outperformed existing protocols in terms of data accuracy, refresh rate and cost.

## What it does
Volatility Vista is a cutting-edge platform that calculates and displays the volatility of a selected basket of cryptocurrency coins. It constantly monitors the market, refreshing its data more frequently than any other protocol, to provide users with the most up-to-date and precise information on cryptocurrency price movements. Users can track the volatility of individual coins, as well as the overall market, helping them make informed trading and investment decisions.

## How we built it
We built Volatility Vista using a combination of real-time data feeds from multiple cryptocurrency sources, facilitated through the chronicle oracle. We store the data on the mantle Blockchain for future reference and use. We also designed an interface to visualize this information in a clear and intuitive manner.

## Challenges we ran into
- **Chronicle Integration**: Integrating oracle was a worthy challenge. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **Integrating Mantle with Chronicle**: Combining mantle (testnet) with chronicle was great because the combination means super cheap transactions and super cheap oracle calls, meaning our protocol can have higher profitability.
- **Positive User Feedback**: From speaking to other people at the hackathon, they are excited about cheap prices for the next bull run.

## What we learned
- **Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics**: Building Volatility Vista deepened our understanding of the intricacies of cryptocurrency markets and how they react to various factors.
- **Data Processing Challenges**: We gained expertise in handling and processing large volumes of data from multiple sources efficiently and accurately.

## What's next for Volatility Vista
In the future, we plan to expand the range of cryptocurrencies covered in our basket, as well as introduce more advanced analytics and predictive features. We aim to provide users with even more tools to make informed decisions in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency trading. Additionally, we will explore partnerships with financial institutions and trading platforms to bring our volatility measurement expertise to a wider audience.
